# GUI to run NEW ERA NE-500 OEM One Channel Syringe Pumps

Credit: this code was originally written in the Abate Lab by Phil Romero (https://biochem.wisc.edu/faculty/romero). It was resurrected by John Halliburton for use with Python 3 and updated into its present form by Kevin and Sakshi while rotating in the Clark lab. We hope you find it useful. Versions for Py2.7 and Qt4 can be found at https://github.com/RomeroLab/syringe-pump-controller.
