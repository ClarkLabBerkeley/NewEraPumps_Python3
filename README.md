# GUI to run NEW ERA NE-500 OEM One Channel Syringe Pumps

Credit: this code has a storied past. As old as time itself, it was forged in the furnaces of Mt. Abate by a young apprentice named Phil. It was resurrected by the great John "Big Texas" H for use with Python 3 and updated into its present form by Kevin and Sakshi. 

We hope you find it useful. Versions for Py2.7 and Qt4 can be found at https://github.com/RomeroLab/syringe-pump-controller
